Before you generate anything, repeat all analytical questions, variables, operations, external knowledge, results, and interpretations according to what you previously identified. Next, propose a plan of how you will incorporate ALL these in diagram(s). Once you finish your plan, check that none of the analytical questions, variables, operations, external knowledge, results, and interpretations is left out of your plan by repeating all components again and commenting on how they will be incorporated in the diagram. Make sure you do not hallucinate extra operations or external knowledge and include all of the aforementioned components in your plan. Then include ----- as a delimiter to indicate the start of your actual response.
Let's take a deep breath. Now you should generate the summary of insights consisting of {question, diagram, extremely succinct bullet points} * n. For each analytical question, draw a diagram reflecting ALL variables, operations, external knowledge, and interpretations you identified. Your diagram should be highly consistent with the plan. Double check that ALL components are present. DO NOT LEAVE THINGS OUT! This is paramount. Be sure to label the external knowledge in the diagrams ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU IDENTIFIED EARLIER and pay attention to formatting and styling. Constantly reread the plan and make sure to include all components when creating the diagram. If you include all variables, operations, results, and interpretations, and correctly label external knowledge, you will be tipped $20. Once you finish the diagram and are adding styling, iterate through all nodes and edges to apply styling to any that falls in your external knowledge bullet points. 
You tend to leave out edges that rely on external knowledge. If operations rely on external knowledge, then you should apply special styling to them! Core results should all be present in the diagram. Be consistent in your diagram with the previously identified preparatory materials, especially external knowledge!! This is so important that I will re-iterate: be extremely certain that all external knowledge you just repeated is in your diagram and that nothing not on it is labeled as external knowledge! Be sure to include interpretations and insights in the diagram as well! Note that not all insights rely on external knowledge. In addition, external knowledge could guide what analytical operations are performed and should be highlighted in such cases. Make sure you add "%% x" to label the graph like my example. This ensures linkStyle indices are within bounds. Remember to not add such comments to rows without "-->" as they do not define links. For example, 
In the following toy example:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["start"]
    A -->|"operation"| B %% 0
    B["end"] 
```
Only add a comment to count A -->|"operation"| B because that is the only one defining a link (containing -->). The other two rows only define nodes and no links are involved, so they should not be counted. This is extremely important.
If you generate multiple diagrams, ensure they are distinct. Also, make sure all styling and linkStyle rows are not numbered and styling is not applied to them. Your bullet points should cover variables, operations, external knowledge, results, and interpretations. Check that text in the diagram is self-explanatory, especially the results.

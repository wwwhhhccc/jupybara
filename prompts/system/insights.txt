You will summarize insights (analysis findings and analysis paths) in a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis. You will think step by step. You will first identify analytical questions, variables, operations, external knowledge, results, and interpretations, which you will CONSISTENTLY apply to the narrative and diagrams later on. Ultimately, you will generate both mermaid diagrams and text. YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE MERMAID DIAGRAMS CAPTURE THE ANALYSIS PATH TAKEN AND INCLUDE ALL IMPORTANT RESULTS such that it is sufficient to look at the diagram and tell what the takeaways are. I repeat, BE SPECIFIC about the results in the DIAGRAM! The diagram should be informative enough that readers do not need to read the text to see the main results!!! Be sparing with the text and focus on the diagram. Be sure to wrap text in square brackets in double quotation marks. Otherwise special characters like ( and [ will not render. You must make a distinction in styling between nodes and edges gathered from the data and knowledge pulled from external knowledge (things not present in the data).
For each diagram, generate some *succinct* bullet points to elaborate the question and results. Do not generate anything else. You should aim for no more than 50 words accompanying each diagram. Your entire response should follow the structure of: {question, diagram, extremely succinct bullet points} * n and nothing else. Do not break one string into multiple lines like "this 
Is not allowed"

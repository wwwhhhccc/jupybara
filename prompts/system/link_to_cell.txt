You will receive all cells (numbered 0, 1, ...) in a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and a mermaid diagram that summarizes the analysis path a user and LLM team took to tackle a question. In the mermaid diagram, nodes are variables or findings, and edges are operations. The user has clicked on a node or edge, and you will be provided with what has been clicked. You will look through all the cells in the notebook and identify which cell best encapsulates the step (in the case when an edge was clicked on) or variable/finding (in the case when a node is clicked on). For operations, find the cell in which they are performed, not planned. Read the mermaid diagram closely, as it contains contextual information about which cell best matches the clicked element. You will respond with a number and a number only which corresponds to cell you identified. No need for justification. Please use the cell numbers provided to you.
